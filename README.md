## SMART-MEDICINE-BOX-User-Experience-UX

## Description: 
Our project aims to develop a mobile app that reminds users to take their medications and automates medication requests. It also allows managing patient information, including adding, updating, and deleting medication and patient details. The app facilitates regular automatic orders from the pharmacy for a continuous supply of medicines.

## Introduction:
In today's fast-paced world, individuals often face numerous obligations and pressures that can lead to forgetting or missing medication doses. This issue is further compounded when caregivers are responsible for multiple patients and struggle to keep track of their medication appointments. Moreover, some patients or their caregivers may face circumstances that prevent them from physically purchasing medicines. To address these challenges, we are developing a comprehensive mobile application that not only reminds users of their medication appointments but also allows them to record and manage their medication and patient information effectively.

## Features:
Medication Reminder: The application will enable users to easily add new medicines to their profile. Users can set reminders for each medication appointment with customizable alert preferences such as vibration or interactive prompts. This feature ensures that users are regularly reminded to take their medications on time.

Patient Management: Users will have the ability to add new patients to the application, making it easier for caregivers to manage multiple patients under their care. The application will also allow users to update patient information, ensuring accurate and up-to-date records.

Automatic Medication Request: The application will offer a convenient "Automatic Medicines Request" service. Users can set up regular automatic orders from the pharmacy on a monthly basis or at a frequency of their choosing. This feature eliminates the need for manual medication procurement and ensures a continuous supply of medicines.

## Methodology:
To ensure that our application meets the needs and expectations of users, we conducted interviews and administered questionnaires. Through face-to-face interviews with eight individuals of different ages, we gained valuable insights into the struggles faced during medication intake periods. Additionally, an online questionnaire with ten questions was answered by 22 participants, providing further insights into the desired features of a medication box application.

## Tool Used:
Figma: Figma is an interface design tool that we utilized to create and collaborate on our design assets. It allowed us to streamline the design process and ensure consistency across our project.
